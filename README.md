# Small Math App Built with Bootstrap, React, TypeScript and Vite

This projected was created to help me put in place some of the basic react principles, and I hope to continue adding to it with best practices as I gain a deeper understanding of JavaScript and React.

You can visit the site at [Do Quick Maths](https://www.doquickmaths.com/), to check out the working example.

## Expanding the Project

I will be expanding the project to further my understanding of react, so please feel free to post any ideas you may have and get involved with the development.

## Installing the Project Locally

To install and run the project locally, first you would need `node.js` and `npm`.

Downloading `node.js` includes the `npm` package manager, [install node.js from here.](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager)

With `node.js` on your local machine, you can now clone the repo or download the `.zip` from GitHub.

Now, open your terminal and from the projects root directory run `npm install`, this will install all the npm packages and dependencies.

Next, again in your terminal from the same directory, run `npm run dev`, this should start the Vite server and you will be able to visit the site from the local host address shown in the terminal.
